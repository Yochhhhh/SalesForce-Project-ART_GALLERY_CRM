Problem Statement – Art Gallery CRM

Art galleries face a unique challenge: while they thrive on creativity and cultural value, their day-to-day operations often remain fragmented and inefficient. Exhibition planning, artist management, artwork inventory, visitor registrations, and sales tracking are typically handled through spreadsheets, emails, or even paper records. This leads to lost opportunities, manual errors in calculating artist commissions, difficulty in monitoring artwork availability, and lack of insights into visitor engagement or sales performance.

To address this gap, the Art Gallery CRM leverages Salesforce to provide a unified, intelligent platform tailored for the art industry. Unlike generic CRMs, this solution is designed specifically for galleries, enabling them to:

Digitally catalogue artists and artworks with rich media, provenance details, and dynamic availability status.

Manage exhibitions end-to-end — from scheduling and artwork allocation to monitoring attendance.

Automate sales workflows by instantly updating artwork status, calculating artist commissions, and generating notifications for curators, finance teams, and artists.

Streamline visitor engagement through registration management, automated confirmations, and personalized follow-up communication.

Deliver actionable insights through dashboards that highlight top-selling artists, exhibition success metrics, and visitor demographics.

By introducing automation, analytics, and a centralized data model, this project not only reduces operational complexity for galleries but also empowers them to strengthen artist relationships, enhance visitor experience, and make data-driven cultural and business decisions.
