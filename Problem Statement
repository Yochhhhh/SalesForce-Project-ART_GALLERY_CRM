üö©Problem Statement ‚Äì Art Gallery CRM

- Art galleries face a unique challenge: while they thrive on creativity and cultural value, their day-to-day operations often remain fragmented and inefficient. 
  Exhibition planning, artist management, artwork inventory, visitor registrations, and sales tracking are typically handled through spreadsheets, emails, or even 
  paper records. 
- This leads to lost opportunities, manual errors in calculating artist commissions, difficulty in monitoring artwork availability, and lack of insights into 
  visitor engagement or sales performance.

- To address this gap, the Art Gallery CRM leverages Salesforce to provide a unified, intelligent platform tailored for the art industry. Unlike generic CRMs,
  this solution is designed specifically for galleries, enabling them to:

- Digitally catalogue artists and artworks with rich media, provenance details, and dynamic availability status.

- Manage exhibitions end-to-end ‚Äî from scheduling and artwork allocation to monitoring attendance.

- Automate sales workflows by instantly updating artwork status, calculating artist commissions, and generating notifications for curators, finance teams, and artists.

- Streamline visitor engagement through registration management, automated confirmations, and personalized follow-up communication.

- Deliver actionable insights through dashboards that highlight top-selling artists, exhibition success metrics, and visitor demographics.

- By introducing automation, analytics, and a centralized data model, this project not only reduces operational complexity for galleries but also empowers them to strengthen 
  artist relationships, enhance visitor experience, and make data-driven cultural and business¬†decisions.
